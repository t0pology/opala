# Project ʻŌpala: Exploring Novel Solutions to Existing Operational Problems in Debris Mapping CubeSat Constellations

**Project Kaihuwaʻa II Student Research Project** // **Spring 2025** // **University of Hawaii Maui College**

*Abstract:*
The rapidly increasing amount of orbital debris currently in our atmosphere is under-mapped, under-researched, and poses a significant threat to nearly all aspects of modern infrastructure. Responding to this threat is a layered and complex undertaking, with several challenges such as minimal debris mapping infrastructure and scarce resources for on-board satellite data processing in orbit. To provide a small contribution to this undertaking, a physical and digital sandbox for testing and implementing novel solutions must first be built. Using five Raspberry Pi 3 B+ microcontrollers with optical Camera Modules, the hardware for a proof-of-concept CubeSat constellation can be simulated. The software environment can similarly be emulated via Raspbian OS and relevant software packages. The primary solution explored will be developing a custom Python 3 DAP (Data Analysis Pipeline) for processing debris imagery in a lean environment. The deliverables of this project will be two-fold: Possible improvements towards on-board data processing methodology, and an easily replicable and affordable debris mapping sandbox (with a corresponding GitHub repository and set-up guide).
